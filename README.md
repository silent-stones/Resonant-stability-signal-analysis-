Resonant Stability Signal Analysis

Overview

Resonant Stability Signal Analysis is an advanced framework for analyzing, visualizing, and understanding the stability of resonant signals. This project applies signal processing techniques such as perturbation analysis, recurrence quantification, and coupled system analysis to explore the behavior of time-dependent resonant signals.

Features

Perturbation Analysis: Examines how signal stability changes under controlled noise injections.

Recurrence Quantification (RQA): Detects signal recurrence, determinism, and entropy trends.

Coupling Synchronization Analysis: Evaluates phase-locking behavior under adaptive coupling conditions.

Interactive Data Visualization: Provides real-time insights through dynamic charts.

Installation & Usage

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/silent-stones/resonant-stability-signal-analysis.git
cd resonant-stability-signal-analysis

2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed, then run:

npm install

3. Run the Application

npm start

4. Upload Your Own Data

Replace Synthetic_Resonant_Dataset.csv with your dataset or modify the analysis scripts to process different signal types.

How It Works

Phase Coherence vs. Noise Level: Tests signal stability under increasing noise levels.

Recurrence and Entropy Analysis: Identifies structured patterns within the signal.

Coupling Synchronization Metrics: Measures resonance effects between coupled oscillators.
